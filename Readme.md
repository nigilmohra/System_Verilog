# System Verilog
This repository contains notes related to SystemVerilog (SV) and the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM). 

Before delving into the semantics of SystemVerilog, basic examples are provided, such as a full adder for a combinational circuit and a simple counter for a sequential circuit, along with corresponding testbenches. The examples can be found in the [Examples](https://github.com/nigilmohra/System_Verilog/tree/main/Examples) folder.
